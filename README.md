# Greenhouse Monitoring System – Temperature Sensing Module

Team of 4 students.  
My role: temperature sensing module designer.  
Designed and implemented an LM35-based temperature sensing module with analog signal conditioning, calibration, and hardware-level error detection.  
The project consists of two stages: a standalone temperature sensing module and system integration with enclosure.
